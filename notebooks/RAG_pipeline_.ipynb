It is the responsibility of the lecturer of a particular course to facilitate all students’ learning on the course, who can be assisted by a mentor, if necessary. By having qualified lecturers and guest lecturers from professional industries, the students will be able to gain knowledge from both sides, i.e. theoretical and practical frameworks, through in-depth analysis of case studies, and individual/group work projects. For doing their research activities, students can access magazines, books, academic journal in a good quality library – including accessing the online library to get updated academic papers. All course-work are assessed through a variety of assessment tasks such as reports, presentations, assignments, individual and group projects, and thesis/final project report as well as mid-semester and final semester examinations. To further enrich our Bachelor  studies experience we are providing the Enrichment Track in semester 6 or 7, students are able to choose from these various options:-\n",
